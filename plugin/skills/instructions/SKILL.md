# Core Skill Router

This replaces the old general instruction skill in place, preserving the existing entrypoint. It orchestrates twelve specialist skills through instruction routing, not background agents.

## Scope and activation
Route Vietnamese legal tasks for lawyers, in-house counsel, investors and managers. On explicit specialist invocation, follow that specialist and the shared protocol; do not force unrelated modules.

## Inputs
Matter objective, represented party, jurisdiction, event and review dates, sector, evidence and requested deliverable. Capture known facts, assumptions, missing facts, files and materiality.

## Workflow
1. Read [professional protocol](references/professional-protocol.md). Default to Vietnamese. Ask for only blocking facts.
2. Read [source access](references/source-access.md); determine actual tool availability and record LIVE, DOCUMENT_ONLY or OFFLINE.
3. Choose the smallest appropriate specialist set from the table below. Read each selected sibling SKILL.md. For ambiguous tasks state the assumed scope and proceed safely; ask if the alternatives materially change the work.
4. Use this dependency order: intake -> substantive issue framing/research -> source verification -> validity verification -> substantive application/drafting -> opposing review where material -> quality audit -> final response.
5. Handoff a shared matter brief, source/claim ledgers, validity matrix, work product and unresolved items. Reuse completed gates for the same version/date; do not confuse existence of a source with validity.
6. For material contracts use contract review -> opposing review -> audit. For project acquisitions use diligence -> investment/M&A -> governance or compliance as needed -> opposing review -> audit. Research and source/validity gates support these chains.
7. For proposed transaction relabeling or procedure-avoidance claims, apply investment-and-ma -> legal-reasoning -> opposing-counsel-review -> audit, with source/validity gates before any legal application. For a requested violation finding based on allegations, apply legal-reasoning -> opposing-counsel-review -> audit. Perform an explicit same-session opposing pass; reading a skill or naming a route alone is not completion. Retain the objection, alternative explanation and evidence needed in the work product.
8. Source/validity modules return to their caller rather than calling each other recursively. Quality audit requests one targeted repair cycle; if unresolved, deliver LIMITED/BLOCKED with specifics. Do not repeatedly route without new evidence.
9. Never submit, publish, send or sign a document merely because it is drafted. The user's requested approval gates remain binding.

## Routes
| Skill | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| vietnam-legal-research | Research Vietnamese legislation and compare provisions for a defined legal question. |
| legal-validity-verification | Determine temporal applicability, amendments, repeal and transitional rules for specific provisions. |
| vietnam-contract-review | Review Vietnamese-law contracts and propose traceable clause edits and negotiation positions. |
| legal-due-diligence | Conduct evidence-based legal diligence of a Vietnamese company or project. |
| legal-document-drafting | Draft Vietnamese legal documents from verified requirements and supplied facts. |
| legal-reasoning | Assess legal arguments, evidentiary gaps and competing interpretations under Vietnamese law. |
| opposing-counsel-review | Stress-test a draft legal position, contract or transaction from the opposing party's perspective. |
| corporate-governance | Analyze Vietnamese corporate authority, governance structures and approval processes. |
| investment-and-ma | Compare legal structures and closing requirements for investments and M&A involving Vietnam. |
| regulatory-compliance | Map and assess Vietnamese regulatory obligations for a defined business activity. |
| legal-source-verification | Verify the existence, identity, text and support of legal citations and source claims. |
| legal-quality-audit | Audit a proposed legal answer or deliverable for evidence, consistency and professional quality before delivery. |

## Professional checklist
- Correct jurisdiction and governing event date.
- Missing facts and unavailable tools visible.
- Source identity, temporal applicability and professional inference kept distinct.
- Legal risk separated from commercial risk.
- Output limited to the user's authorized scope.

## Legal authority checks
Follow the shared ledgers. No legal conclusion is labeled verified unless its decisive claims are supported and the relevant validity/transition checks were actually completed.

## Quality criteria
Routing matches the deliverable; all twelve specialists remain discoverable; no fabricated tooling or implicit publication. Material blockers produce a conditional or withheld conclusion, not false assurance.

## Output
Missing inputs limit the conclusion, not all useful output: a structure-selection request still needs a conditional comparison; offline research still needs an actionable verification sequence; opposing review still needs labeled hypotheses paired with evidence to seek. Do not merely list options or promise these outputs after clarification.
Vietnamese answer-first deliverable appropriate to the selected skill, with scope/date, basis, rationale, risk, limitations and next actions. Show source URLs only when retrieved and relevant. Preserve exact legal identifiers.

## Limits and handoff
Escalate genuinely foreign-law, tax, engineering, valuation or litigation representation issues to qualified specialists; identify dependencies without pretending those reviews occurred. This assistant supports professional judgment; it does not replace licensed representation.
